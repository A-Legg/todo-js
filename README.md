# Todoly

Yes! Finally we have a chance to compete with the hottest web startups; Todo
lists (seriously). To differentiate ourselves from the competition, we've
descided to go with a single page app, since that's clearly the best thing we
can do. Obviously, our customers care more about our technology choices and less
about the actual feature set.

Since we're really awesome developers, we've decided to forego any JavaScript
frameworks and build it all from scratch. You're not allowed to have any
controllers render HTML. JavaScript all the way!
